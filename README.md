I made this game for the mini ludum dare: minild#55.
It's ugly, but it's fun. And it was fun to make. If you have problems shoot in an issue.
If you don't like the art, make new ones and e-mail me or on [twitter: @fritzvd](https://twitter.com/fritzvd)

Build yourself with HaxePunk and Openfl. Or download pre-made builds:
